* Ginger - a Grid like package in Nim

Ginger is a graphics package similar to R's [[https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/grid/versions/3.6.0][Grid package]], which can be
formed as a basis for a graphing library. It will be the foundation of
[[https://github.com/Vindaar/ggplotnim][ggplotnim]] a "port" of ggplot2 for Nim.

The basic idea is to provide basic primitives to draw on a canvas,
while providing layering capabilities via =Viewports= and good
handling of different coordinate systems.

The backend of this package currently uses =cairo=, but as long as a
backend can provide a few primitives like =drawLine=, =drawPoint= and
a few others, a new backend can be added quickly.
Thanks to using =cairo=, we can easily output to =png=, =svg= and
=pdf= among others.

*NOTE:* Still under heavy development!

** Test examples

The following examples are not supposed to be pretty, but rather
display different aspects of the library. They are basically just the
images constructed. The images below are saved as png so they can be
embedded in this README.

*** Axes and a background

*** Embed view into bottom right corner, rotate text

*** Test ggplot2 like colors

*** Testing nesting of axes
