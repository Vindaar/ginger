* Ginger - a Grid like package in Nim

Ginger is a graphics package similar to R's [[https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/grid/versions/3.6.0][Grid package]], which can be
formed as a basis for a graphing library. It will be the foundation of
[[https://github.com/Vindaar/ggplotnim][ggplotnim]] a "port" of ggplot2 for Nim.

The basic idea is to provide basic primitives to draw on a canvas,
while providing layering capabilities via =Viewports= and good
handling of different coordinate systems.

The backend of this package currently uses =cairo=, but as long as a
backend can provide a few primitives like =drawLine=, =drawPoint= and
a few others, a new backend can be added quickly.

*NOTE:* Still under heavy development!
