* v0.1.15
- fix =pointWidth= and =pointHeight= to return real width and height
  of viewport
- add arithmetic procs for =Quantity=.
  These respect absolute units and try to remain them. If both are
  absolute, result is absolute. If only one is absolute the result
  will also be absolute. Only relative returned if both are relative.
- fix arithmetic for =Coord1D= to effectively follow the same rules as
  the ones for =Quantity= mentioned above
- fixes many wrong scales used for conversions / embeddings
  -> This and the above means adding an absolute distance to some
  quantity or coordinate will now result in that distance on the final
  plot, no matter how embedded the current viewport is!
- add =drawBoundary= proc to highlight different viewports (including
  writing its name / a number into the center with different colors)
- =initLine= is now public
- tick label related procs now allow custom margin to be set (by
  default it's 0.4 cm for y labels / ticks and 0.5 cm for x labels / ticks)
- tick calculations now fully respect =boundScale= if given (that is
  the resulting's objects (and view's) data scale is =boundScale=
  instead of the new scale
- =layout= is significantly improved. It allows absolute units and
  does not convert these to relative. However, margins are not allowed
  (have no effect) at the moment. But they were broken.
- add support for gradients. So far only on rectangles, but that's an
  easy fix.
